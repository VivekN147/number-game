# Tell me more!
I wanted an easy way to grab the songs present in my library so I can download it & use it offline(Spotify still hasn't launched here. Y U NO COME?). [spotify_to_mp3](https://github.com/frosas/spotify-to-mp3) worked well but it relied on grooveshark, which unfortunately is no more.

So I wrote this script which mimics that library, but instead of downloading from grooveshark, it provides you with a file of youtube URLs which you can then plug into [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)
